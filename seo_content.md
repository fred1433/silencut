**Post:**
Hey podcasters! 

I got tired of spending 30+ minutes manually cutting silences from my episodes, so I built a free online tool that does it automatically.

Just upload your audio/video, and it:
- Detects all silence periods
- Removes them intelligently (keeps speech flow natural)
- Reduces file length by 60-70% on average

No software to install, works in browser: silencut.com

Would love feedback from fellow podcasters!
